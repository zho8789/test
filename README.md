1. Test Task
	depenedency:
		selenium 3.9.0 (python package)
	Browser: firefox

	Please start test.py script
		python test.py

2. Demo(auto arbitrage-betting software) 
	This is a bot software that scrapes odd values from several sport betting sites(ex: https://www.bet365.com, https://www.188bet.com,...) 
	and places bet on games on which arbitrage betting is possible.
	Unfortunately,it's automatic betting function is not working now.
	That is why, because several monthes has passed since I developed this project, my client changed his password and it is impossible 
	for this software to login in these sport betting sites using his original password.
	So, without logging in, it can not place any bet on the games.  
	But the source code are all implemented now.
	If you want, I can send you my code snippets.


Best regards, thanks.
